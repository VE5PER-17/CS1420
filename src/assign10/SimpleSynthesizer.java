 * A simplified midi synthesizer.

 * a much simpler interface for it.
 * 
 * The available channels and instruments depend on your machine. The
 * midi system is supposed to support 16 channels, but there may be some
 * variation. If a specified channel is not supported by the system, the
 * methods will have no effect, but should not throw exceptions. This is
 * to avoid crashes on irregular hardware.
 * If your machine does not provide midi support, this class can still
 * be used but will not produce any sound. In that case, It will appear 
 * to have one DEFAULT instrument.
